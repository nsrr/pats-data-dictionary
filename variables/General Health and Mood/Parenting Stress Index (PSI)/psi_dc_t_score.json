  "description": "The Difficult Child (DC) subscale is based on 12 items from Parenting Stress Index Fourth Edition Short Form. DC subscore measures a parent's view of his/her child's temperament, defiance, non-compliance, and demandingness. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale (from 1-5). T-scores generally range from 20 points to 100 points, and are considered the primary source for interpretation. T-scoring below 62: within normal limites; 63 to 64: borderline levels; 65 to 66: clinically significant level; above 67 (equivalent to percentile rank of 95% or higher): clinically severe levels.

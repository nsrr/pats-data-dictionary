  "description": "The Parental Distress (PD) subscale captures the level of distress resulting from personal factors such as depression or conflict with a partner and life restrictions due to a parent's perception of his or her child-rearing competence. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale (from 1-5). T-scores generally range from 20 points to 100 points, and are considered the primary source for interpretation. T-scoring below 62: within normal limites; 63 to 64: borderline levels; 65 to 66: clinically significant level; above 67 (equivalent to percentile rank of 95% or higher): clinically severe levels.

  "description": "The Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (PCDI) subscale assesses the extent to which a parent feels that his/her child is not meeting expectations and that interactions with the child are not reinforcing. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale (from 1-5). T-scores generally range from 20 points to 100 points, and are considered the primary source for interpretation. T-scoring below 62: within normal limites; 63 to 64: borderline levels; 65 to 66: clinically significant level; above 67 (equivalent to percentile rank of 95% or higher): clinically severe levels.

  "description": "Authoritative parent behavior summary score is based on 13 items from the Parenting Style Questionnaire Short Form (PSQ-SF). Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (from 1: never to 5: always). The total score is the sum of all 13 items divided by 13 (range 1 to 5). The highest calculated score indicates the preferred parently style. Authoritarian parents are highly demanding and are often punitive and forceful in order to adhere to an absolute standard for behavior, conceptualized as rejecting and psychologically controlling.

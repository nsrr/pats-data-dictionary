  "description": "The CBCL is a caregiver-completed assessments of child behaviour, used to detect behavioural and emotional problems in children and adolescents. The CBCL/1.5-5 (ASEBA, Burlington, VT) was administered to children 5 years or younger, while the CBCL/6-18 was administered to children 6 years or older. The total score combines the internalizing and externalizing scores, summarizing of all specific behavior problem scales obtained from the pre-school or school age versions according to the childÂ’s age. Higher T-scores indicate worse functioning, and a T-score of 65 or higher is considered clinically abnormal. <br><br>Reference: [Achenbach TM, Rescorla LA.

  "description": "Calendar dates were shifted by a random amount of days as part of the data de-identification process. All calendar dates for a given subject have been offset by the same amount of days. The National Institutes of Health Toolbox 9-Hole Pegboard Dexterity Test was used to assess fine motor control. Scores for this test are the times needed for the child to put each of nine pegs into the pegboard and then take them out using each hand, converted to age-adjusted scale scores (higher is worse).

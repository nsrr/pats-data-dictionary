  "description": "Component from the Go-No-Go Continuous Performance Task (GNG/CPT), which is a computer-based attention test developed for longitudinal studies of heterogenous samples of children ages 3 to 12 years. The primary test outcome from this test is d prime (d) for the Continuous Performance Test trial block, a signal detectability parameter that assesses the childs ability to correctly identify targets corrected for their response bias (higher is better).

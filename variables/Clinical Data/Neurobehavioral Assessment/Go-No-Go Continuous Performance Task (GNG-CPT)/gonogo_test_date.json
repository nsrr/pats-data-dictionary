  "description": "Calendar dates were shifted by a random amount of days as part of the data de-identification process. All calendar dates for a given subject have been offset by the same amount of days. Component from the Go-No-Go Continuous Performance Task (GNG/CPT), which is a computer-based attention test developed for longitudinal studies of heterogenous samples of children ages 3 to 12 years. The primary test outcome from this test is d prime (dÂ¬Ã­) for the Continuous Performance Test trial block, a signal detectability parameter that assesses the childÂ¬Ã­s ability to correctly identify targets corrected for their response bias (higher is better).
